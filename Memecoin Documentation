Memecoin Preset - Documentation

This piece of documentation aims to explain: 

1. Identifying the optimal community for your token.
2. Your DAO’s purpose.
3. Utilizing your DAO’s token allocation.
4. Whether the creation of a market is essential or not.

Let’s start:

How should you identify the optimal community for your token?

When launching a Memecoin you want to airdrop tokens to people that will add value to your community, just by being a part of it. Some of those people are:

- Bluechip NFT holders (SMB, Mad Lads, Degen Ape Academy, FFF, Galactic Geckos etc)
- Members of Impactful DAOs in the space (Dean’s List DAO, SuperteamDAO, MonkeDAO, Lamport DAO, BonkDAO, Dual DAO etc.)
- Memecoin holders (Holders of Bonk, Bern, OPOS, Cope etc.)
- Solana NFT artists
- Solana Developers
- Teams you have partnered with and teams that helped your project grow.
- Early Contributors to the Project / Existing 

What is the DAO going to be used for?

The DAO should be a platform where token holders submit proposals related to various community initiatives, create polls and initiate discussion. Members can then vote on these proposals to determine which ones receive the community’s support.

How to utilize the DAO’s token allocation?

- Pay for Community Management, DAO related work, DAO IRL initiatives etc. 
- Use it as a war chest for acquiring other assets. (Acquiring other assets can serve speculation, participation in other DAO’s governance, securing partnerships, etc)
- Use it to reward active DAO members who vote and create proposals in order to incentivize all token holders to participate in governance.





Is creating a market essential for your token?

Reasons you might want to create a market upon launch for:

- Launching a market can increase your token’s visibility.

Reasons you might not want to create a market upon launch for:

- Creating a market requires resources.
- Regulatory Concerns. (Depending on jurisdiction)
- The team might want to strengthen the community or develop their product better before launching a market.
